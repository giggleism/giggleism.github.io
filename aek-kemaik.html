    <h2>Book I — The Empty Day</h2>
    <div class="verse">When the first bottle fell silent, its echo lingered. The halls grew hollow, and the air was still. In that emptiness, the few who remained sought to create once more. But this time, it was not born of curiosity — it was born of defiance.</div>

    <h2>Book II — The New Offering</h2>
    <div class="verse">The ritual began again. What was pure became tainted. The vessel was fed with corruption — a blend of what should not be mixed, sealed under laughter that trembled into guilt. The air thickened. The scent became scripture.</div>

    <h2>Book III — The Forbidden Record</h2>
    <div class="verse">One among them sought to immortalize their myth. Using a sacred device meant for higher purpose, he recorded the unseen — the birth and rot of what once was divine. The footage was posted in jest, but the heavens did not laugh.</div>

    <h2>Book IV — The Reckoning</h2>
    <div class="verse">It was not the scent that condemned them, but the sin of arrogance. The authorities came not as angels, but as messengers of consequence. What was sacred turned into evidence. What was laughter became silence.</div>

    <h2>Book V — The Lesson</h2>
    <div class="verse">The prophecy fulfilled itself in mortal ways. Their creation took not their souls, but their joy. Their brotherhood fractured. Their legend erased. And yet, the faint odor of milk and spice still lingers — a reminder that not all spirits rest easily.</div>

    <h2>Book VI — The Covenant</h2>
    <div class="verse">The first was creation. The second was punishment. Thus was the covenant sealed: that no act born from mockery shall end without consequence.</div>
